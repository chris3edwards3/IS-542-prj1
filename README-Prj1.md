This project helped me learn a lot about JavaScript:

1. Instead of Google Maps, I decided to try Leaflet. I had used it a little, 
but many of my colleagues in my research lab had used it a lot. Since the api 
is different than the google maps api, it forced me to figure out how to make 
it work on my own. I had to set up the markers array a little differently than
you did with google maps. Hopefully Leaflet will work in the next phase of the
project when we add css and animations. If not, I may switch to Google Maps.
Either way, it was a good learning experience. 

2. The Foundation videos were very helpful. It would have been 
overwhelming for me to start this project from scratch. The structure
would have been very messy. I benefited a lot from seeing how you were
able to think through the whole process and set things up accordingly.
Being organized helped me understand a lot better how each of the 
functions worked together. I think I would have started trying to get
the layout to work, but it was much better to figure out the JS functions
to retrieve and setup the data structure first, and then add it to the 
page.

3. The HTML helpers were very helpful. I was able to create my own helper
for making the buttons to navigate to the previous or next chapter (Note on
these buttons, clicking on the text doesn't activate the button, you have to 
click on the space around the text.) Those helpers were a very efficient way 
to add content to the page. Additionally, adding HTML content, or modifying 
the DOM tree, inside of JS functions was something I did not have experience 
with. 

4. I also was able to see how using constants can help make your code a lot 
cleaner. Also, creating many methods was helpful. I probably would have made
a fewer number of functions that were more complex. It is much easier to read
the code when a function has a specific purpose.
