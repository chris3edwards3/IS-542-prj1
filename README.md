This exercise helped me understand and practice a variety of JavaScript concepts.

I had not done a lot of raw JavaScript programming, so callbacks were new to me.
Using the callback ensures that our functions are executed in the correct order.
In this case, the Init function is first, then the ajax, then the cacheBooks.

Along with the practice with callbacks, I understand more about how arrow functions
work. When we call the ajax function, we give it the URL and then an arrow function
for the second argument. This argument is the success Callback function. This makes
it so that we know that books and volumes are loaded correctly before we execute
the cacheBooks function.

It was also good to practice parsing through a json file to find specific
information. I thought the website about jquery being unnecessary was interesting
as well. It shows the importance of staying up to date in the capabilities of
different languages.

Lastly, the framework used in the JavaScript file was very helpful to me.
Separating it out into different sections helped me to understand what was
happening better. It provided a good template for me to follow.
